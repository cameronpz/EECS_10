In this program I have a main function and then all of the other DIP operations as separate functions. 
We have a main menu to pick which DIP operation the user wants to do on the image. 
There are comments to describe all the operations. 
I implemented it with a main and various programs for ease of debugging (as you can comment out all other functions to debug one that is broken) and also for ease of reading
